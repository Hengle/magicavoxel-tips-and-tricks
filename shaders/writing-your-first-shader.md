# Writing Your First Shader

To write your first shader all you need is a simple text editor: my favourite is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but anything will be just fine.

## Creating the File

First of all you'll have to create your shader file inside the _shader_ folder of your MagicaVoxel installation:

1. Navigate to tour MagicaVoxel executable location and open the _shader_ folder
2. Create a new text file and name it _color-replacement.txt_
3. Open the file
